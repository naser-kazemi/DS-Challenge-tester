# Pattern Matching Engine

## Phase 1
This phase is implemented as a suffix trie data structure in Java. Given a text file, model generates a suffix tire from the text, storing all possible suffixes present in the text. then using this data structure, it searches each given query and finds it.

## Phase 2
This phase is based on the suffix trie in the previous phase implemented in C++; with a hash array data structure to store original file of occurrence of each query.


## Tester
You can find a judge written in Python in `tester` directory. It's functionality is explained in detail in corresponding readme file.
